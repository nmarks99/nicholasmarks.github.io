# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am currently pursuing a M.S. degree in mechanical engineering at Northwestern University. The focus of my master's degree is specifically in the areas of robotics, dynamics, and controls. My primary interests however are in aerospace engineering, and more specifically, applying my knowledge and skills in robotics, embedded systems, feedback control systems, and dynamics modelling/simulation to aerospace problems.
