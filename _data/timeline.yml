- title: Mechanical Engineering Intern
  from: July 2021
  to: September 2022
  description: As a mechanical engineering intern, I lead the development of a
               custom CNC machine to automate the hand layup process for making ceramic
               matrix composite laminates. This included writing a G-code generator in
               Python as well as building the custom CNC machine from off-the-shelf 3D 
               printer parts and custom machined parts I made in-house with a waterjet.

- title: X-Ray Optics Researcher
  from: 2018
  to: 2021
  description: Worked on the research and development of adaptive optics technology
               for use in creating deformable X-ray telescope mirrors. 
               Our goal was to demonstrate nanometer level control of the surface of
               a mirror using the controlled application of a magnetic field. I created
               a suite of MATLAB programs for characterizing and analyzing surface 
               profile data. I also created MATLAB software to switch between AC and 
               DC power supplied that were connected to an electromagnet.
