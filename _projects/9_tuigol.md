# Terminal UI (tui) Game of Life (gol)
*Code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nmarks99/tuigol)*

Neither the first nor the last implementation of Conway's Game of Life in your terminal.
For now the result is pretty uninteresting since the only option is to start with a 
random initialization. Later on I plan to add a user friendly way to specify a 
starting condition as well as define some preset conditions like the 
[glider gun](https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/Gosper_glider_gun) or this 
cool [spaceship](https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/119P4H1V0)
