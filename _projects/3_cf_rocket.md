# 2020-2021 NASA Student Launch Competition
For the 2020-2021 NASA Student Launch Competition, I served as Launch Vehicle Lead
on the NUSTARS (Northwestern University Space Technology & Rocketry Society) rocket team.
The competition involved designing and building a high-powered rocket and a lower power 
subscale version of this rocket which were used in a competition against other universities.

By the end of the competition, the rocket was succesfully launched and recovered twice, 
and reached an altitude of around 6000 feet. An in depth report on the design of the rocket
and its payload can be found here: [Critical Design Review Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lUvlw2wy5XPRs8bfzJ51ImAOtUyFA1xE/view?usp=sharing)

An image of the core team members (I'm the first to the right of the rocket) on the lauch pad as
well as a video of the launch can be seen below.

## Design & Construction
As launch vehicle lead, I led the design and construction
of the launch vehicle which utilized various carbon fiber manufacturing
techniques such as filament winding, vacuum bagging, and hand-layups. This rocket
was the first in the history of the NUSTARS club to make all airframe components 
entirely in-house.

The video below shows the carbon fiber filament winding machine in action
as it winds a section of airframe for our sub-scale launch vehicle. And the completed 
subscale launch vehicle is shown as well.
