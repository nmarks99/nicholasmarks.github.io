# Scratch Built Carbon Fiber Rocket

For the 2020-2021 NASA Student Launch Competition, as Launch Vehicle lead
on the NUSTARS (Northwestern University Space Technology & Rocketry Society) rocket team,
I led the design and construction of the launch vehicle which utilized various carbon fiber manufacturing
techniques such as filament winding, vacuum bagging, and hand-layups. By the end of the competition,
the rocket was succesfully launched and recovered twice, and reached an altitude of around 6000 feet.
