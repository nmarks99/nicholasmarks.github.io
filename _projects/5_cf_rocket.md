# NASA Student Launch Competition 
For the 2020-2021 NASA Student Launch Competition, I served as Launch Vehicle Lead
on the NUSTARS (Northwestern University Space Technology & Rocketry Society) rocket team.
The competition involved designing and building a high-powered rocket and a lower power 
subscale version of this rocket.

By the end of the competition, the rocket was succesfully launched and recovered twice, 
and reached an altitude of around 6000 feet. 

A video of the first launch can be see below.

## Design & Construction
As launch vehicle lead, I led the design and construction
of the launch vehicle which utilized various carbon fiber manufacturing
techniques such as filament winding, vacuum bagging, and hand-layups. This rocket
was the first in the history of the NUSTARS club to make all airframe components 
entirely in-house.

The video below shows the carbon fiber filament winding machine in action
as it winds a section of airframe for our sub-scale launch vehicle. And the completed 
subscale launch vehicle is shown as well.
