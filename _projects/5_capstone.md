## Project Goal
The goal fo this project was to develop a landing system capable of landing a small
rocket vertically at a designated target zone, without the use of traditional
combustion engines. Theproduct will function completely autonomously from the start of its descent
until stable landing on the landing pad.
The device will also adhere to typical guidelines and mission goals set by the NASA
Student Launch competition in order to benefit future NUSTARS
(Northwestern University Space Technology and Rocketry Society) competition teams.

Demonstrated here is an initial prototype of the design which includes a rocket airframe
with deployable landing legs and propellers.
