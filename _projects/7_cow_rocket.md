## Design and Construction
To obtain my level 2 high power rocketry certification through the
National Association of Rocketry (NAR), I built and launched this 
rocket, which I call the "Cow".

The rocket's airframe is made of resin infused carboard tubing
which I then wrapped in carbon fiber for added strength. The fins were
made from carbon fiber plate I layed up by hand and cut out with a CNC mill.

The avionics section of the rocket consists of a 3D printed sled which holds
redundant dual-deploy altimeters which are responsible for parachute deployment 
and data logging. Several additional images can be seen below.
